# Login-system
My amateur login system

1. Create email account (https://accounts.google.com/signup) for login-system and turn-on this option: (https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)
2. Configure config.py file
3. Install requires.txt (pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
4. Go to the project folder and type in cmd: uvicorn main:app
5. Voil√†! You have login system on your own Go to the localhost:8000 and enjoy.
