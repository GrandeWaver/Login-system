# Login-system
My amateur login system

1. Create email account (https://accounts.google.com/signup) for login-system and turn-on this option: (https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)
2. Configure config.py file
3. Install requires.txt (pip3 install requires.txt)
4. Go to the project folder and type in cmd: uvicorn main:app
5. Voilà! You have login system on your own.

(btw my version of python: 3.8.5)
